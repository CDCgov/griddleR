# griddleR

:warning: Development of [pygriddler](https://github.com/CDCgov/pygriddler) has diverged from development of griddleR. As of pygriddler [v0.3](https://github.com/CDCgov/pygriddler/releases/tag/v0.3.0), the griddler syntax has been reformulated, and functionality beyond parsing griddles has been removed. griddleR uses should not expect feature parity or regular updates.

---

griddleR is an opinionated tool for managing inputs to simulations or other
analytical functions. This package includes functionality for:

- Parameter sets: an extension of `list` that does some extra validation and can
  produce stable hashes.
- Griddles: a YAML-based format for specifying grid-like lists of parameter
  sets.
- Running a function over multiple parameter sets, and "squashing" the results
  into a single [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).
- Running a simulation function over multiple replicates with specified seeds.

This package is intended to be an R port of the Python
[pygriddler](https://github.com/CDCgov/pygriddler) package. Not all
functionality will be identical between the two packages.

See the [pygriddler documentation](https://cdcgov.github.io/pygriddler/) for
more details.

## Package overview

This package helps wrap your simulations' input and output.

The basic assumption is that you have some function, say `simulate()`, that
takes a named list of parameters and returns a tibble. For example, an ODE SIR
model would take in $R_0$, infectious period $1/\gamma$, and some other
parameters, and return a tibble of times and compartment sizes.

## Parameter input

This package provides a standard file format, called the **_griddle_**, to
articulate parameter inputs, including options for specifying:

- Baseline parameters
- A grid of parameter values, to produce varied simulations
- Named scenarios, with specified, non-gridded parameter values

### Specification

- The input parameter specification is read from a YAML with
  `yaml::read_yaml()`.
- The specification is a named list:
  - It must have at least one of `baseline_parameters` or `grid_parameters`.
  - If it has `grid_parameters`, it may also have `nested_parameters`.
- `baseline_parameters` is a named list.
  - The names are parameter names; the values are parameter values.
  - The parameter values need not be scalars. E.g., it might be a list of
    strings.
- `grid_parameters` is a named list.
  - The names are parameter names. Each value is a vector or a list. The
    elements in that list are the parameter values gridded over.
- `nested_parameters` is an _unnamed_ list.
  - Each element is a named list, called a "nest."
  - Every nest have at least one name that appears in the grid.
  - Names in each nest must be either:
    1.  present in `grid_parameters` or `baseline_parameters` (but not both),
        _or_
    1.  present in each nest.

This parameter specification parser will produce a list:

- Each element of which is a named list of parameters, called a "parameter set".
- The length of which is equal to the product of the lengths of the parameter
  value lists in `grid_parameters`.

### Example: grids

This griddle will produce 4 parameter sets, over the Cartesian product of the
parameter values for $R_0$ and $1/\gamma$. Each parameter set will have 3
parameters: $p_{I0}$, $R_0$, and $1/\gamma$.

```yaml
baseline_parameters:
  p_infected_initial: 0.001

grid_parameters:
  R0: [2.0, 3.0]
  infectious_period: [0.5, 2.0]
```

### Example: nests

If you want to include nested values, use `nested_parameters`. The names in each
nest that match `grid_parameters` will be used to determine which part of the
grid we are in, and the rest of the parameters in the nest will be added in to
that part of the grid. Nested parameters can be used to make named scenarios:

```yaml
baseline_parameters:
  p_infected_initial: 0.001

grid_parameters:
  scenario: [pessimistic, optimistic]

nested_parameters:
  - scenario: pessimistic
    R0: 4.0
    infectious_period: 2.0
  - scenario: optimistic
    R0: 2.0
    infectious_period: 0.5
```

This will produce 2 parameter sets.

## Replicates

A convenience function `replicated()` allows your to wrap your simulation
function `simulate()` with a seed and number of replicates. These parameters
(`seed` and `n_replicates`) must be present in the parameter set passed to
`replicated(simulate)()`. The wrapper will remove those values before passing
the remainder to `simulate()`. It will set the seed, then run that number of
replicates. Each output tibble from `simulate()` will have a `replicate` column
added.

For example:

```yaml
baseline_parameters:
  p_infected_initial: 0.001
  seed: 42
  n_replicates: 100

grid_parameters:
  R0: [2.0, 3.0]
  infectious_period: [0.5, 2.0]
```

This will still produce 4 parameter sets, but if passed to
`replicated(simulate)()`, it will produce 400 output tibbles.
